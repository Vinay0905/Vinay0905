## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 ECE undergrad from Chennai, exploring the intersection of **AI, systems, and computer vision**.  
- 🧠 Building **RAG chatbots**, **agentic LangGraph workflows**, and **YOLOv8-based safety & detection systems**.  
- 🛠️ Love stitching together **backend systems (FastAPI, microservices)** with **ML pipelines** and **real-world sensors (ESP32-CAM, cameras)**.  
- 💡 Enjoy research-style, debug-heavy work: optimizing pipelines, latency, and reliability end-to-end.

## 🔥 What I’m Doing Now

- 🧩 Designing **agentic RAG workflows** with **LangGraph + LangChain** for more “thinking” chatbots.  
- 📚 Diving into **multi-index vector DBs**, **OpenCV tracking**, and **AI safety for camera systems**.  
- 🧮 Grinding **LeetCode (400+ problems)** to sharpen data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving.  
- 🎯 Long-term goal: become a **next-gen AI + Hardware generalist** who can move from RTL to RAG in one day.
